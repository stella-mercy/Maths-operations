# Maths-operations

Operators can be defined as the symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the operands For example, ‘+’ is an operator Here, ‘+’ is the operator known as the addition operator, and ‘a’ and ‘b’ are operands. The addition operator tells the compiler to add both of the operands ‘a’ and ‘b’. The functionality of the C programming language is incomplete without the use of operators.
